# Regression Model in Keras: Concrete Compressive Strength

In this project, data about concrete compressive strength is modeled using a Keras Regression Model. We experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and observe how these parameters impact the model's performance.

The data can be accesed at: https://cocl.us/concrete_data. 

The predictors of concrete strength include:

- Cement

- Blast Furnace Slag

- Fly Ash

- Water

- Superplasticizer

- Coarse Aggregate

- Fine Aggregate
